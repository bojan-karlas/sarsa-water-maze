# Reinforcement Learning: SARSA Algorithm Applied to Pathfinding inside the Morris Water-Maze

This code was produced as part of a mini-project for a [course at EPFL](http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/unsupervised-and-reinforcement-learning-in-neural-networks-CS-434) entiteled "Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning in Neural Networks". It is written entirely in MATLAB. For a better understanding of the algorithm and an overview of some results, please check out my [project report](https://github.com/bojan-karlas/sarsa-water-maze/blob/master/report/Bojan-Karlas-SARSA-Watermaze-Report.pdf).

The main functionality is implemented in the `Arena.m` file. Run the `Arena_demo.m` file to observe the learning process. Other files are mostly for plotting visualizations.
